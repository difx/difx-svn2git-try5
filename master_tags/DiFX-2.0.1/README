#### INSTALLATION ##############
To install DiFX-2.0.1, first go to the area you wish the source code to reside and
checkout the code with svn co https://svn.atnf.csiro.au/difx/master_tags/DiFX-2.0.1.
You probably already did that, if you're reading this README.  cd to DiFX-2.0.1, 
and then:

1) Ensure you have a working installation of IPP and MPI
2) Open setup.bash or setup.csh in your favourite text editor and change the
DIFXROOT, IPPROOT, MPICXX and PGPLOT paths and the perl versions to suit your system
3) source setup.bash (or .csh). You will probably want to add this to your 
.bashrc or .cshrc file
4) Run "./install-difx"

Thats it. DiFX should compile - if not, check out the troubleshooting
area on http://cira.ivec.org/dokuwiki/doku.php/difx/start
